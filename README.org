* Description
While surfing the internet, we need to save links which are necessary to fetch the relevant information but putting them all in the same bookmarks folder can create a mess, so I made this extension in order to save links which you need in the near future but not for a longer period of time although you can use this as a replacement to your bookmarks since this extension enables you to open links with keyboard shortcuts ,which is much faster.

* Main Feature
First 9 links in the link list can be opened with the key combination Alt+Shift+(link position)
